        * ido-occur.el (ido-occur--lines-as-string): Simplifying.
        Get all lines from begining to end.

        * ido-occur.el (ido-occur--lines-as-list): Respects `CURRENT-POINT'.
        List lines from `CURRENT-POINT' to end of `BUFFER' and from end of
        `BUFFER' to beginning of `BUFFER'.

        * ido-occur.el (ido-occur): Depend on `ido-vertical-mode`, and
        enable it explicitly while calling `ido-completing-read`.

        * README.md: Add installation section.
